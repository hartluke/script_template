        <li><b>Run Mode:</b> Choose the mode in which you want to run the script. The options are 'Production' and 'SB'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you've filled out all the necessary fields, click the 'Run' button to execute the script. You can monitor the progress of the script through the loading dialog that appears.</p>
